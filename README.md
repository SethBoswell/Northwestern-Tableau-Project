## Overview of Analysis
This project folder provides a variety of data visualizations that analyze a company that offers bikesharing services throughout the New York City downtown area. There are a variety of visualizations, created in Tableau, that describe who the customers are, what days/times they use the service, how long they use the service for, and in what areas of New York. Below I include each visualization and provide a brief description of the information gleamed.
## Results
![Viz 1](https://github.com/SethBoswell/bikesharing/blob/main/Images/Viz%201.png)
The vast majority of users have trips that last shorter than an hour. The most frequent trip duration is only 5 minutes.

Males take many more trips at all different levels of trip durations; however, each gender shows a similar pattern of peaking at around 5 minutes as the most common duration.

This heatmap shows that users tend to take more trips around the 8 AM and 5-6 PM mark, likely when they are going to and from work. You can also see that Saturday adn Sunday have higher user trips throughout the normal hours of the day, likely as people are engaging in leisurely activities.

This heatmap is similar to the previous one, but it breaks the data down by gender. The first interesting point is that the same pattern remains with regards to Saturday and Sunday being high use days as well as 8 am and 5-6 pm being high use times. That said, you can also see from this graph that the predominant users are once again male instead of female, or unknown.

In this final graph, the data is broekwn down by user type (customer vs subscriber), weekday, and gender. The main observation from this data is the larger number of trips are taken by male subscribers throughout the entire week. This suggests that marketing efforts could either target these specific types of users, or they could try to gain more interest from their lagging user types (e.g., female non-subscribers).  

![Viz 6](https://github.com/SethBoswell/bikesharing/blob/main/Images/Viz%206.png)
From this pie chart, you can also see the majoirty of users are subscribers, again suggesting that the predominant customer base has subscriptions to use this service.

Finally, in this graph, you can see the most trips are occurring in lower Manhatten. It would be interesting to investigate whether this is the result of more bikes being in this area, or if it's due to the high population density in lower Manhatten.
