## Overview of Analysis
This project folder provides a variety of data visualizations that analyze a company that offers bikesharing services throughout the New York City downtown area. There are a variety of visualizations, created in Tableau, that describe who the customers are, what days/times they use the service, how long they use the service for, and in what areas of New York. Below I include each visualization and provide a brief description of the information gleamed.
